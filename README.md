# Link The World

![ts](https://flat.badgen.net/badge/Built%20With/TypeScript/blue) ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

This is a React project using TypeScript and the Material UI library for simple social media development with a mocked backend through the JSON Placeholder REST API.

## For the testing

Open terminal in your downloaded project folder and type:

```
npm install --force
# Part of MUI (@material-ui/core) is not fully compatible with React >= 16.8.0, which is why --force is necessary.
```

> **Warning**
>
> There are no code comments yet, and there are still many things to improve.

I wish you the best of luck with testing the app! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="20px">
